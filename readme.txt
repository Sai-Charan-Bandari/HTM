Hello everyone!
This is our project: Todo List with reminder
Working:
Users need to create an account and login.
Then they can create an new group or join an existing group.
Already joined groups will be displayed.
The user can enter any group to see the list of tasks to be done, which are relevant to the members of the group.
All the tasks are added by the members of the group only, and are visible to the entire group.
We can even add a reminder (as date and time) so that all the members get an alert (reminder) to complete that task.
This application is especially beneficial when we have multiple works to be done, we may overlook or forget some really urgent tasks.
This application helps us set a priority to our tasks.
The list of tasks are regularly updated by the group members.
Regulary checking out the tasks will keep us up to date of all our works.
Thank You!
